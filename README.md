		<li> Assessing building damage<br>
		<span style="color:blue"> ENEA </span></li>
		<li> Extracting key features of buildings from satellite data<br>
		Through deep learning techniques, satellite data can leveraged to extract key features of buildings, including their size, shape, function, and spatial distribution. This enables high-precision assessments of urban structures, supporting a range of applications from urban planning and development to disaster response and energy management. By automating the feature extraction process, the integration of deep learning reduces the time and cost associated with manual mapping, making it possible to analyze large, complex datasets in near real-time.<br>

		<li>Monitoring subsidence or uplifting of coastal shores<br>
		This project proposes a workflow that effectively outlines the presence of both subsidence and uplifting. These phenomena deserve continuous monitoring, both for environmental and infrastructural purposes. Using persistent interferometry collected from satellites and clustering algorithms we highlight the presence of homogeneous patterns using an  hypothesis testing procedure to evaluate and establish the presence of significant local spatial correlations (the LISA method). The designed workflow ensures the retrieval of homogeneous clusters and a reliable anomaly detection. <br>

	<b>Critical Infrastructures</b><br>	
	Critical infrastructures are the backbone of modern society, supporting everything from daily necessities to advanced technologies. Ensuring the resilience of these systems is vital for maintaining public safety, economic stability, and national security. Disruptions to critical infrastructures—such as power grids, transportation networks, or water supply systems—can have far-reaching consequences. Key infrastructure sectors include Transportation Networks (roads, bridges, railways, airports, and ports that enable the movement of goods and people), Power Distribution Networks (Energy grids and power plants that supply electricity), Water Supply Systems (Water distribution and wastewater treatment facilities).
