	<b>Buildings</b>
	<ul>
		<li> Assessing building damage<br>
		Building damage assessment involves evaluating the potential or actual damage to structures due to various hazards. The combination of hazard and vulnerability models allows for risk assessment, which estimates the expected damage to buildings due to earthquakes.<br>
		<span style="color:blue"> ENEA </span></li>
		<li> Extracting key features of buildings from satellite data<br>
		Through deep learning techniques, satellite data can leveraged to extract key features of buildings, including their size, shape, function, and spatial distribution. This enables high-precision assessments of urban structures, supporting a range of applications from urban planning and development to disaster response and energy management. By automating the feature extraction process, the integration of deep learning reduces the time and cost associated with manual mapping, making it possible to analyze large, complex datasets in near real-time.<br>

		<li>Monitoring subsidence or uplifting of coastal shores<br>
		This project proposes a workflow that effectively outlines the presence of both subsidence and uplifting. These phenomena deserve continuous monitoring, both for environmental and infrastructural purposes. Using persistent interferometry collected from satellites and clustering algorithms we highlight the presence of homogeneous patterns using an  hypothesis testing procedure to evaluate and establish the presence of significant local spatial correlations (the LISA method). The designed workflow ensures the retrieval of homogeneous clusters and a reliable anomaly detection. <br>
