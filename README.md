		<summary>Quantifying and evaluating the heat-stress hazard variability</summary>
		The aim of this project is the assessment and evaluation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect.
		To address this, a daily mean temperature map has been developed for Tuscany at a fine spatial scale of 100 × 100 m, using machine learning algorithms that integrate remote sensing (satellite) temperature data with urbanization and monitoring station data. 
		A harmonized geocode database has been created by combining Earth Observation (EO) satellite data, ground-monitoring stations, and other spatiotemporal predictors for Tuscany from 2003 to 2022.

			Two-stage approach utilizing machine learning algorithms (gradient-boosted trees). In the first stage, missing moderate-resolution land surface temperature data from MODIS were imputed using spatiotemporal predictors (e.g., solar geometry and topography). In the second stage, spatiotemporal variations in observed ground-based Tmax and Tmin air temperature data were modeled at a 100 × 100 m resolution across Tuscany, incorporating stage-1 MODIS data and a range of variables, including topography, solar geometry, land cover, population, meteorological parameters derived from ERA5-land, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

			<summary>Social impact</summary> 
			Populations living in cities are particularly vulnerable to non-optimal temperatures, urban areas often experience significantly warmer ambient temperatures compared to surrounding rural regions. As a result of this project, daily maps of Tmax and Tmin for Tuscany for the year 2022 have been produced.
